# Project Overview

## My 1st attempt on making Wordle.

## Deployed Game Site [link]()

# Project Description

My take on Wordle using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I made it a little more challenging by lowering the number of tries to 5 from the normal 6. I will continue to update this project as I learn more/get feedback.

Used the wordle game for inspiration/wireframe [link](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [link](https://github.com/Ethan-Is-Kool/all-wordle-words/blob/main/possible%20answers.json) for the json word list the game is currently using.

# MVP/PostMVP

## MVP

- No errors while playing the game.

- Clean layout and accessability.

- Have tiles change color reflect if the entered letter is in the word or not.

- Allow any 5 letter word to be entered to make the game more challenging.

## Post MVP

- Want key tiles to also change colors like tiles when letters are matched.

- Add more features, like css animations when tiles change.

- Make GIFs appear when players win depending on which row they got the word a different gif will show.

- Add a light theme for morning people.

- Would also like to add spanish words as well which will add a great combo for spanish/english players.

- Lastly, I would like to add longer words, maybe some 6-8 letter words as well.
